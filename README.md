# Hand Gesture Recognition
For my hand gesture recognition project, I will use Python 3 for coding and integration. TensorFlow and Keras will train the recognition model, while OpenCV will capture and process facial images. PySerial will connect Python to the Arduino Mega 2560, programmed in the Arduino IDE, to control hardware actions based on recognition results.
